# odin-recipes
The Odin Project's recipes is the first project of TOP.
It was supposed to be done using basic knowledge of HTML and CSS learned on the previous lessons, however, I tought: *make it spicy*! and googled how to make it a little bit cuter.
I used variables to create my own color names and learned flexbox in order to position stuff around just the way I wanted to.
